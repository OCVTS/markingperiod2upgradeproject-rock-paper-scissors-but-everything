                <div class="flex-item">

            <p>This is Rock paper scissors, a game in which 2 players will go back and forth picking between Rock, Paper, or scissors. Whoever wins is based on the picks. Rock beats scissors, paper beats rock, and scissors beats paper. This function of this game, is to give players more options to play, and gives players their own option that a computer can't select. This is to show a variety that the player and computer can choose to find ways to win. This is to also make the game a lot more fn in the sense that the user doesn't have to pick rock, paper, or scissors and can be a bit more creative with the way they play.

            <p>Some problems I ran into when creating this project was trying to get the timer, and scores to display, along with getting the many different options for the player to choose to fully work properly. Once things started working properly and were funtional as intended, it began to get easier building the page to how I envisioned it. Some features I added to improve the webpage was a link to an assets page, that lists off the different types of options both the player and computer can choose, and options only the player can choose. Along with the assets list, I added a timer that shows how long the page has been open for. I plan on updating this to only go up when the game starts and how long you have been playing the game before the user resets the page.</p>
